# Covid-modeling

This repository provides an example of Covid
spread modelling based on the SEIR model described in:

R. Jayatilaka et. al. "A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission", *Materials Today: Proceedings*, vol. 54, pp. 101-112 (2022).

Python was used to solve the differential equations used in the model, for different values of incubation rate, infection rate, removal rate, and reduced spread rate factor.
